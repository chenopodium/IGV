<!-- Profile describing how to load data from a SQL database-->

<!-- A database element describes a connection to a single database.
This includes separate path elements (host, path, port).

version
   Version of the descriptive file, not the database. Used to ensure
   compatibility with future versions

    Human-readable name of database

<!--
A database can have any number of tables within it.
For each table, we have to specify the location
of certain columns.
name
    Exact name of the table
description
    Human-readable description of data
binColName
    For efficient lookups, many databases use an r-tree,
    and store the bin number. See
    http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Bin_indexing_system
    for UCSC binning structure. If this column name is provided,
    we assume such column exists and it uses this binning structure.
chromoColName
    Column name which stores chromosome names
format
    Table must be in a format which IGV can read, that is,
    the rows must be in the same order/meaning as one
    of the file formats IGV can read. "format" is file extension
    that the table is similar to (e.g. bed, psl, ucscgene).
    We say "similar" because the startColIndex/endColIndex
    fields can be used to take a subset of columns
posStartColName
    The name of the column which contains the start positions
    of each feature. Necessary for constructing queries.
posEndColName
    Name of the column which contains end positions of each feature.
startColIndex
    1-based Column index from which to start reading data. Default 1.
 endColIndex
    1-based column index, inclusive, at which to stop reading data.
    Default 2147483646 (Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1, ie all)
