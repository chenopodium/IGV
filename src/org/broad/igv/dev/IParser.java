/**
 * This interface acts as a bridge between different containers of data,
 * separating retrieving that data from processing. The motivation was integration
 * with SQL databases.
 * <p/>
 * Consider a tab-delimited text file. The standard method of parsing
 * is to read each line, splitting each line into a {@code String[]},
 * and reading each string into a float, double, string, or whatever.
 * {@link StringArrayParser#getString(TContainer, TIndex)}
 * has TContainer = String[], and TIndex = Integer, and simply
 * returns the String at location given by the Integer.
 * <p/>
 * Consider the same data stored in a SQL database. Each line stores
 * essentially the information, although we have the advantage that
 * SQL columns are typed. {@link org.broad.igv.dev.db.SQLLineParserByName}
 * reads ResultSet, and uses column names (String) to identify the location.
 * One could also use Integers to index the columns, if desired. This way
 * we retain type information on columns; the data is never treated as a String
 * (unless it is).
